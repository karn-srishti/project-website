		<h2> <u>History Of AI</u> </h2>

		<div class="history"<p> The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be traced back to ancient Greek mythology and the concept of automata, which were mechanical devices that could perform human-like tasks. However, the modern era of AI began in the 1950s when researchers started exploring ways to create machines that could "think" and "reason" like humans. </p>

<p> In 1956, the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined at the Dartmouth Conference, where researchers from various disciplines came together to discuss the potential of creating machines with intelligence similar to that of humans. This event is often considered as the birthplace of AI as a scientific discipline. </p>

<p> During the 1950s and 1960s, there was significant progress in AI research, including the development of symbolic AI and the introduction of machine learning. However, progress slowed down in the 1970s, and AI was seen as a failed experiment due to the inability of machines to match human-level intelligence. </p>

<p> The 1980s saw a resurgence of AI research, with the introduction of expert systems and the development of more powerful computers that could process vast amounts of data. In the 1990s, AI technologies such as neural networks and genetic algorithms emerged, and AI applications became more widespread in fields such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. </p>

<p> In the 21st century, AI has continued to advance rapidly, with the introduction of deep learning and reinforcement learning, which have enabled machines to perform tasks such as image and speech recognition at a level that surpasses human performance. Today, AI is being used in various fields, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, natural language processing, and healthcare, among others. </p>
