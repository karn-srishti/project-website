<h2><u> Types of Artificial Intelligence</u> </h2>
Below are the various types of AI:
<ul>
<li><strong> Purely Reactive - </strong>
These machines do not have any memory or data to work with, specializing in just one field of work.
 For example, in a chess game, the machine observes the moves and makes the best possible decision to win.</li> 
<li><strong> Limited Memory - </strong>
These machines collect previous data and continue adding it to their memory. They have enough memory or experience to make proper decisions, but memory is minimal. For example, this machine can suggest a restaurant based on the location data that has been gathered. </li>
<li><strong>Theory of Mind - </strong>
This kind of AI can understand thoughts and emotions, as well as interact socially. However, a machine based on this type is yet to be built. </li>
<li><strong> Self-Aware - </strong>
Self-aware machines are the future generation of these new technologies. They will be intelligent, sentient, and conscious. </li>
</ul>
